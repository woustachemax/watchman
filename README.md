# Hello World üëã Welcome to Watchman üíÇüèª

**What is Watchman?** 
Watchman is a next-generation uptime monitoring platform that combines traditional website monitoring with the power of Web3 functionality.

### The Problem with Traditional Uptime Monitoring
Traditional uptime services operate using dedicated machines in fixed locations. For example:
- Your website is hosted in Boston
- Local machines ping your site regularly
- If your site doesn't respond, you receive alerts

### The Watchman Difference
By integrating Web3 technology, Watchman creates a decentralized monitoring network where:

1. **Real Users** monitor your website from diverse global locations
2. **Earn Crypto** as bounty rewards for performing monitoring tasks
3. **Get Authentic Insights** about your site's performance across different regions and network conditions
